CSS::Language
=============

CSS::Language is a validating parser for CSS1 CSS2.1 and CSS3, based on CSS::Grammar.

It has a broad understanding of all properties and elements and is able to both:

- validate to the same level as the W3C CSS validation service, and
- produce simple customised ASTs for individual properties.

Each of the above grammars will be somewhat refactored and considerably fleshed out over the coming weeks.
